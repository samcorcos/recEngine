# RecEngine
==============

Simple, easily implemented recommendation engine.

```
$ meteor add samcorcos:recengine
```

Associate items based on user "likes" using the syntax:

```
recEngine.upvote('<USERID>', '<ITEMID>')
```

Then, to get a recommendation, use the syntax:

```
recEngine.suggest('<USERID>', <NUMBER OF SUGGESTIONS>, function(error, result) {
  // "result" is an array of objects
  // Within the "result" object is "suggestion" and "weight"
  // "suggestion" is the item being suggested
  // "weight" is the strength of the suggestion -- higher number means stronger suggestion
})
```

## Algorithm

Suggestions are produced using the [Ford-Fulkerson algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford%E2%80%93Fulkerson_algorithm), which computes the maximum flow in a flow network.

To provide an analogy, think of the algorithm as finding the most efficient way to drive from point A to point B, taking into consideration the number of lanes each street hasâ€”streets with more lanes are better.

Much of the logic comes from https://gist.github.com/methodin/1561824


## Basic Example

This works not only with `USERID`s, but with colloquial names and just about anything else. For example, you could install the package and write the following:

```
if (Meteor.isServer) {
  Meteor.startup(function () {
    recEngine.upvote("Mike", "cake");
    recEngine.upvote("Mike", "coffee");
    recEngine.upvote("Mike", "pie");
    recEngine.upvote("Bob", "coffee");
    recEngine.upvote("Bob", "cake");
    recEngine.upvote("Alex", "yogurt");
    recEngine.upvote("Alex", "cake");
    recEngine.upvote("Zeke", "cake");
    recEngine.suggest("Zeke", 3, function(err,res) {
      if (err) console.log(err);
      console.log(res);
    })
  });
}
```

... and your console should read:

```
[ { suggestion: 'yogurt', weight: 4 },
  { suggestion: 'coffee', weight: 2 },
  { suggestion: 'pie', weight: 2 } ]
```

This means that Zeke would most probably like yogurt given the preferences of his peers, and would probably also like coffee and pie, though, to a lesser degree.
